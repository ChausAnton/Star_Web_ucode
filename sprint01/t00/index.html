        <p>Batman is one of the worlds most famous and favored superheroes, but he is also once of the most unusual.  Appearing in comics, television, and major motion pictures, Batman hides behind the identity of Bruce Wayne, a playboy billionaire and industrial tycoon.  As a child, Wayne witnessed both his parents murdered in front of him and vowed to revenge their deaths by fighting crime.  Undergoing a journey for both physical and mental excellence, Wayne transformed himself into the dark hooded and caped Batman.  Batman's transformation into a hero is unique as it is relatively realistic and purely self-motivated.

As identified by Joseph Campbell in his novel "A Hero with a Thousand Faces", individuals who refuse their call to adventure or heroism do so because of fear.  As an ordinary man who chooses to step up and fight crime, Batman overcomes this fear at an individual level and his example encourages society to do the same.  As a superhero, Batman continues to be unique as he is a very dark figure.

        Often referred to as the masked vigilantly, Batman is frightening and intimidating in the manner befitting a villain.  Frequently accused of being a criminal himself by the citizens of Gotham, Batman is not afraid to break the law to achieve a higher goal.  As depicted in the film “The Dark Knight,”
