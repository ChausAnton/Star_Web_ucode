                        A tad expensive perhaps, but as a branded lunchbox then, I guess that's fair enough. It's certainly of a decent quality and has plenty of room.</p>

                    <p class="content"> Started to use first week back and the Valero has started to come off 3 days in ðŸ˜  tried on two occasions to contact the person nothing back. I wish at the cost I paid for this talked my son in to an asda Â£5 that at least last us 12 months not 3 days. Sad I have to write it but the money I paid I'm not impressed</p>

                    <p class="content"> Good size and depth for school lunches. My son loves it. Very impressed. The velcro straps on the back are designed to attach to backpack. They don't seem to make good reviews but as we are not attaching to a backpack we have no issues with them. Would definitely recommend for a Minecraft fan. Would buy again.

                    <p class="content"> I bought this for my 9 year old grandson and his face lit up when he unwrapped it. He is a avid player of Minecraft and is over the moon with this addition of his Minecraft collection.
                        This is not a cheap lunchbox and you pay for what you get in my opinion, this will last a long time and stand up to the treatment only an 8 year old can give it!</p>
