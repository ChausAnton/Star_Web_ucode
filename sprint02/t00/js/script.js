    alert("Hello JavaScript from outside")
    /*The alert() method displays an alert box with a specified message and an OK button. An alert box is often used if you want to make sure information comes through to the user. Note: 
    The alert box takes the focus away from the current window, and forces the browser to read the message.*/
